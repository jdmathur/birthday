                	<h2>TED</h2>
                    <p>
                    	TED is a non profit organisation owned by the Sapling Foundation started out in 1984, to bring together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment and Design. TED was formed to disseminate Ideas worth Spreading. It observes the convergence of the fields of Technology, Entertainment, Design; upholding a strong belief that ideas have the power to change attitudes, lives and ultimately the world. With a goal to offer free knowledge and inspiration from the world's most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other; it addresses a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture in a way that makes them alluring. The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can. TED shares a glorious past of emphatic presenters that include Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Bill Gates, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Stephen Hawking, Steve Jobs, James Cameron and many Nobel laureates as well.<br/>

                        TED Talks began as an initiative to share what happens at TED with the world, so under the moniker "ideas worth spreading" talks were released online. They rapidly attracted a global audience in the millions. Indeed, the reaction was so enthusiastic that the entire TED website has been reengineered around TED Talks, with the goal of giving everyone on-demand access to the world's most inspiring voices. As of November 2012, TED Talks have been viewed more than one billion times.
                        TEDIndia was held in November 2009 in Mysore, India, celebrating and exploring the beckoning and bright future of South Asia. The speakers included technocrats like Nandan Nilekani, Pranav Mistry; activist like Mallika Sarabhai and Politician like Shashi Tharoor.

                    </p>
                    <h2>TEDx</h2>
                    <p>
                    	TEDx events are locally organised TED events where 'x' stands for independently organised TED event. In 2009, TED started giving licences to third parties to organise TED like events internationally. The aim was the same; to disseminate Ideas worth Spreading but with no objective of making profit.<br/>

                        The TEDx program gives communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at the local level. These events are planned and coordinated independently and to spread free knowledge among the masses. TEDx provide a suite of short, carefully prepared talks, demonstrations and performances on a wide range of subjects to foster learning, inspire young minds and provoke conversations that matter. It aims to be a bias free programme - lacking a commercial, political or religious agenda. Our event TEDxIITBHU is one such event.

                    </p>
                    <h2>TEDxIITBHU</h2>
                    <p>
                    	In its first edition, TEDxIITBHU explores into themes and topic that not just affect India but the world as a whole. Set in the backdrop of the holy city of Varanasi, it takes an inspiration from its rich cultural heritage and forces you to catechize on the building blocks of society. It aims at bringing together distinguished speakers from various fields to create a conglomeration of ideas capable of igniting major changes at a local as well as global level, aiming to make substantial impact in the way we perceive things. It is also an impalpable attempt to open up new avenues for debate, providing an opportunity for a one on one interaction between the Speaker and the attendee. So join us on the 7th of April, 2013 as we witness the beginning of a TEDx culture, here at IIT (BHU) Varanasi.<br/>
